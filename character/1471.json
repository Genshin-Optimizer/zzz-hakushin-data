Knowing he's out of touch with modern trends, he's been secretly trying to learn the latest internet slang... yet his half-baked grasp of it tends to end in funny little misunderstandings.\n\nBanyue also appears to have a strange liking for round things — stone balls, spherical bollards, and the like.

      "3": "Banyue's true identity is that of a killing machine secretly developed years ago by TOPS, specifically designed to suppress Miasma and codenamed \"Purge Unit - Type Zero.\" The algorithm implanted within him drives him to act according to the most logical solution for eliminating Miasma, which often results in indiscriminate annihilation of all moving targets within sight, including both the Miasma and affected civilians.\n\nAfter a failed operation, Banyue, then still a mere machine, was abandoned by TOPS, but was then discovered by a sage visiting the Lemnian Hollow, who rewrote his Core and constructed new intelligent logic for him, allowing Banyue to gradually develop self-awareness. Later, Banyue was accepted by the residents of the old mining site in Waifei Peninsula, where he integrated into \"human\" life.\n\nDuring the catastrophic Miasma outbreak at the old mining site ten years ago, Banyue rushed to rescue the civilians, yet under the influence of his perfectly rational algorithms, he abandoned those he deemed beyond saving. Though he saved the young Ye Shunguang and Ye Shiyuan, this planted a deep-seated guilt within him for \"abandoning those in need.\" As a result, Banyue never took the Forbidden Fruit test, and despite meeting the criteria of an Intelligent Construct, he remains officially unrecognized as one.\n\nAfter receiving judgment from Dialyn, a Judge of the Krampus Compliance Authority, Banyue resolved to atone for his past regrets by protecting the future. Through Dialyn's recommendation, he has now become a Judge of the Krampus Compliance Authority, embarking on a completely new journey.",
