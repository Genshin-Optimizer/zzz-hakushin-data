The residents — whose lives had been covered by massive insurance policies — were doomed to die within the Hollow, and Dialyn was simply the bait to keep them from fleeing.\n\nShe heard her secret curse betrayed, the hatred the dead had towards her, the voices of all who perished, and the lies of those who lived. She can no longer recall how she made it through that barren wasteland. But ever since Krampus took her in, she's been ready: Amid the unending struggle between lies and truth, she would learn to pass her own judgment on good and evil.",
