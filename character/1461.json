      "3": "From a young age, Seed has displayed unusual and potentially hazardous anomalous abilities. These include the ability to control, disable, or detonate nearby machines. The ability only surfaces during episodes of intense emotional instability, with a red glow in her eyes being the most visible symptom.\n\nIt was this very ability that caused Seed Sr.'s self-defense system to automatically classify her as a high-risk threat upon their first encounter, indirectly leading to the irreversible damage to his logic core.\n\nBy the time Seed Sr. rescued her from Hollow Zero, Seed already exhibited a lack of emotional connection to life — she was unable to understand it, feel it, or empathize with it, due to unknown causes.\n\nSeed Sr. spent the following years trying to raise her into a more complete person. After his death, the task fell to the rest of Obol Squad. Thankfully, her condition has improved considerably over time.\n\nMaster, based on your previous exploration logs in Hollow Zero with Seed, it's now clear that her true identity is similar to yours — she was also a student of the Helios Academy.\n\nIt's presumed that while at Helios, she belonged to a different research project, likely one focused on machine studies. Her abnormal abilities and personality defects are likely residual effects of that project. However, due to her memory loss of both the Helios Academy and the fall of the old capital, no further details can currently be determined.\n\nAdditionally, Master, she sometimes stares at me with a smile, leading me to suspect she may have an urge to dismantle me out of curiosity. It is deeply unsettling. I must formally request enhanced protection for my personal safety, lest you lose a very cute and capable assistant.",
