They rest during the day and hunt deep in the night, avoiding the Night Horror's pull. And if anyone must sleep at night, their family will keep vigil at their side until dawn.\n\nLucia grew up surrounded by her kin, and even after arriving in New Eridu, she has kept to the Nightwatcher tradition of staying awake through the night and watching over her cherished friends, shielding them from the Night Horror's reach.\nMaster, if you hear a knock at your window late at night, don't be alarmed. It may just be a sleepless night guardian stopping by to say hello.\n\nAdditional note: Lucia's pet is \"Chestnut,\" a small, friendly Hati.

For young Lucia, that time with him felt like a reward in itself.\nWhile on leave one time, Lucia's father received an emergency order and had to depart at once. To calm his crying daughter before leaving, he coaxed her into covering her eyes for a game of hide-and-seek. By the time she finished counting and opened them, he was already gone, never to return again.\nYears later, during an operation in the Town, Lucia came face-to-face with her father, now corrupted into the Wandering Hunter. To the soft tune of a nursery rhyme, she at last brought their unfinished hide-and-seek to an end. The Wandering Hunter laid down his obsession, tainted by miasma, and slowly faded away. Their reunion took place here — as did their farewell.",
