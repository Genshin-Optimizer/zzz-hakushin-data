  "Desc": "Under the long-lasting distortion of control in the name of love, the girl resorts to lying to deceive the suffering victims who have lost their loved ones to the Hollows, all in the pursuit of attention and love from her closest kin.\nShe believed that as long as she helped her loved ones hide the secret of the \"Blessing\" medicine, as long as she could not hear the agonizing screams of the people being affected by corruption, and as long as this secret and vile experiment remained concealed, the bond between her and her loved ones would not break.\nBut in the end, what awaited her was witnessing her loved one take his last breath in a pool of blood.\n\nAfter that, hatred and jealousy, like sharp thorns, constantly pierced her heart.\nThe gears of vengeance gnawed at every ounce of her sanity, and she pieced together a twisted meaning of existence from the notes left behind by her loved one.\nHer life trajectory seemed like a dark fable about obsession.\n\nWhen former companions extended their hands of salvation to her, the girl could no longer turn back. Or rather, the words that tried to pull her back into the light were torn to shreds by the jealousy, obsession, and hatred that had burrowed deep into her bones.\nIn the end, as the sun was about to set, countless spikes surged forth, bursting from her body, each bone shard piercing the screams of the forsaken.\nTepes – the pitiful one pierced by thorns - walks toward the deeper abyss with hatred.\n\"Especially at night, its voice is more sorrowful than that of other remains, and if you listen closely, the sound seems like the cry of a woman...\"",

  "CardSkillDesc": "During the battle, Tepes frequently uses the spiked hammers in both hands to launch powerful attacks and inflict a damage reduction effect. Successfully executing Defensive Assists multiple times to block Tepes' hand attacks will Impair its spiked hammers. Once the hammers are Impaired, some of Tepes' moves will reveal significant openings, the damage reduction effect will be lost, and Tepes will be inflicted with an increased Daze Vulnerability."
