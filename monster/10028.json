It is likely that it was once a gang member or raider living in the Hollow.\nThe creature's physical characteristics indicate its past as a long-range weapon specialist. Despite losing its free will and life due to Etherealization, it retains its instincts and habits for long-range combat. Its corrupted form enables it to launch projectiles, attacking enemies from a distance. The Ether corruption has enhanced its shooting abilities and projectile firepower. (For example, these creatures may fire sharp Ether Crystals or mixed explosives.)\n\"I told him not to touch that crystal, but he wouldn't listen! That reckless idiot never listens! By the time we were about to leave the Hollow, he... he changed...\"",
